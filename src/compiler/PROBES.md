# Probe measurements

⚠ **This file exists so that recording a measurement does not cost a rebuild.**
`scripts/probe-batch.sh` builds *before* it prices, so a round that writes its
numbers into a `.cpp` comment must rebuild to commit them — measured on
2026-08-29, that is one extra ~150 s build plus a re-run of L1, the ledger and
`-L bc` under a new build identity, for no change in behaviour. This file is not
compiled. It sits beside the sources and is versioned with them.

⚠ **The link to the code is a SYMBOL, never a line number.** A line number in a
record about another file goes stale silently and a stale number is read as
current. `scripts/probe-log-lint.py` checks every `site:` here against the named
file and reds if the symbol is gone — so a rename breaks the record loudly
instead of leaving it pointing at nothing.

⚠ **A record here is a MEASUREMENT, not a verdict about the tree.** Each carries
the build it was taken under, because a ceiling decays as the ledger shrinks and
a cost grows as the corpus widens: both numbers are about a population that
moves. Re-price before funding anything measured more than a round ago.

## selftest_refuse
site: src/compiler/borrow_check.cpp::record_borrow
build: 3aeaa1737dd22dd3
measured: 2026-08-29
fires: 364946
ceiling: 365
cost: 1033
verdict: the harness's known answer — it must close everything
note: refuses every borrow the pass records. A reader that has never SEEN a row
  close cannot tell a dead hypothesis from a broken reader, and on its first run
  this one WAS broken. `ceiling-probe.sh --selftest` asserts it closes the whole
  ledger; if that number is ever small, the READER is what broke, not the tree.

## selftest_inert
site: src/compiler/borrow_check.cpp::record_borrow
build: 3aeaa1737dd22dd3
measured: 2026-08-28
fires: 1599734
ceiling: 0
cost: 0
verdict: the null pole — it must change nothing
note: proves the reader does not invent changes. Fires on every recorded borrow
  and moves no verdict in either direction.

## recvresvamut
site: src/compiler/borrow_check.cpp::check_recv_conflict
build: 3aeaa1737dd22dd3
measured: 2026-08-29
fires: —
ceiling: 5
cost: 11
verdict: STOP — and the decline was for the WRONG REASON
note: recorded as a stop sign for days. Compiling each cost fixture by hand
  showed all nine are ONE diagnostic — "cannot borrow 'X' as mutable: not
  declared as mut" — i.e. `take_borrow`'s binding-mut check, not the reservation.
  All nine are rc 0 under the narrow `recvamutraw`, which landed at 3/0. A
  mechanism buried as too expensive was buried for a reason that was not its own.

## rootkeep
site: src/compiler/borrow_check.cpp::extract_borrow_place
build: (pre-store; measured against the 447-row ledger)
measured: 2026-08-27
fires: 427
ceiling: 0
cost: 0
verdict: REFUTED at the IndexRead site; NOT MEASURED at the SliceIndex twin
note: ⚠ ONE NAME GUARDED TWO BAILS. The coverage map counts 21,299 arrivals at
  the IndexRead spelling and ZERO at the SliceIndex one, so the 427 fires
  measured the first and said nothing about the second. The fire counter cannot
  catch this by construction — it aggregates by NAME, so two sites are one
  number. Only a per-region count separates them.

## genrecvtie
site: src/compiler/borrow_check.cpp::take_ref_borrows
build: (pre-store)
measured: 2026-08-27
fires: 1
ceiling: 0
cost: 0
verdict: UNPRICEABLE by the ledger — not refuted
note: fired ONCE in 423 ledger compiles and 14,075 times over the pass corpus,
  where it still changed nothing. An insurance probe on the same lookup without
  the pruning guard fired 176,555, which proved the site hot and named the
  pruner. The defect's population is the stdlib and pass corpus, not the ledger:
  proven-live is necessary and not sufficient.

## fldrootbits
site: src/compiler/borrow_check.cpp::field_borrow_conflicts
build: armed gate build 22 (unarmed baseline 21; probe batch of 2026-08-29)
measured: 2026-08-29
fires: 5354921
ceiling: 1
cost: 0
verdict: ✓ the PATH-keyed reader never asks the ROOT bits — predicted set closed EXACTLY
note: the 2026-08-28 clang enumeration read 76 accesses in the OTHER direction (a
  ROOT reader while a path is held) and classified all 76 correct: 0 defects.
  This is the inverse, and it is a defect. `field_borrow_conflicts` is the ONLY
  path-keyed conflict reader in the file — 30,490,642 arrivals in the 8060-run
  coverage map — and it reads `mut_field_borrows` and `shared_field_borrows`
  and nothing else. So `let b = &a;` (which sets `shared_borrows` on the ROOT,
  not a path) followed by `let z = a.i;` (a field move, checked only through
  this reader) is admitted. PREDICTED borrowck-move-from-subpath-of-borrowed-
  path; CLOSED exactly that, both directions empty. COST 0 over the ledger's
  legal halves — and rule 5 applies: no counter-example was hand-written.
  ⚠ CEILING 1 off 5.35M fires is not a big prize, but it is a one-site
  delegation at the single reader every path-keyed question already goes
  through, and the callers inherit it for free.

## recvfieldpath
site: src/compiler/borrow_check.cpp::check_recv_conflict
build: armed gate build 23 (unarmed baseline 21; probe batch of 2026-08-29)
measured: 2026-08-29
fires: 85
ceiling: 1
cost: 0
verdict: ✓ the ROOT-keyed gate BAILS on a projection — predicted set closed EXACTLY
note: `if (bp.root.empty() || !bp.path.empty()) return;` is the first line of the
  method-receiver conflict gate: a receiver reached through a FIELD is not
  checked at all. ISOLATED ON ONE VARIABLE, by hand, before the probe:
    let mut v: Vec<i64>; let e = &v[0];   v.push(1);    → REFUSED (2 diagnostics)
    let mut t: Thing;    let e = &t.v[0]; t.v.push(1);  → ADMITTED
    let mut t: Thing;    let e = &t.v;    t.v.push(1);  → ADMITTED
  The only difference is one field hop. The probe routes the non-empty-path case
  to `field_borrow_conflicts` — the reader that already answers exactly this —
  instead of returning. PREDICTED issue-82032; CLOSED issue-82032, both
  directions empty.
  ⚠ RULE 4: 85 fires over the ledger. A small population, so the ceiling is a
  weak bound in both directions.
  ⚠ `refwhole` (below) closes the SAME row by collapsing every ref-rooted place
  to the whole root, at COST 600. Same row, two spellings, 600x the price.

## dwatunwrap
site: src/compiler/borrow_check.cpp::check_place_mut_use
build: armed gate build 24 (unarmed baseline 21; probe batch of 2026-08-29)
measured: 2026-08-29
fires: 467
ceiling: 0
cost: 0
verdict: ⛔ REFUTED for the two rows it was aimed at — the AddrOfTemp hop is not what holds them open
note: the DerefWrite arm hands `check_place_mut_use` a place computed from
  `v.ptr()`, and for the `s.f = v` spelling that is an `AddrOfTemp`, on which
  `extract_borrow_place` breaks — empty root, null `through_ref_type`. So the
  landed E0594 "behind a `&` reference" rule (which closed 4 rows for the
  `*h.r = v` spelling) looked structurally unable to run for a plain field
  write. Unwrapping one hop closes NOTHING.
  PREDICTED issue-85765 (`let rofl: &V = &mut test; rofl.n += 1;`) and
  issue-93093 (`fn bar(self: &S) { self.foo += 1; }`). Both stayed open.
  ⚠ THE FIRE COUNT IS COARSER THAN THE SITE. `probe::on` sits FIRST in the `&&`
  chain, so 467 counts every arrival at that call, not the AddrOfTemp subset —
  the site is proven live, the SUB-population is not. Whoever re-opens this
  must move the `probe::on` after the `kind()` test.
  The residual question is upstream: for these two rows the walk either never
  calls `cross()` on the `&`-typed root, or the compound `+=` spelling takes a
  door that is not DerefWrite at all. Not measured here.

## recvpartial
site: src/compiler/borrow_check.cpp::method_self_kind
build: armed gate build 25 (unarmed baseline 21; probe batch of 2026-08-29)
measured: 2026-08-29
fires: 10017
ceiling: 2
cost: 0
verdict: ✓ a METHOD-CALL RECEIVER is never asked about partial moves — and COST 0 has a counter-example behind it
note: `consume()` reads `moved_fields` and refuses "use of partially moved
  value"; `check_live` does not, and the receiver position reaches only
  `check_live`. HAND-WRITTEN, ONE VARIABLE, BEFORE THE PROBE — all three
  programs partially move `line2.origin` and then use the whole value:
    eat(line2);        → REFUSED   "use of partially moved value 'line2'"
    let _c = line2;    → REFUSED   same
    line2.consume();   → ADMITTED  (by-value `self`, rc 0, no diagnostic)
  One token apart. This is why COST 0 here is worth more than the other zeros
  in this file: the shape was found by construction, not by corpus silence.
  PREDICTED borrowck-uninit-field-access. CLOSED that AND
  moves/move-deref-coercion — an `nllmoves.B` row nobody nominated, and it is
  the same observation in a second ledger block. Predicted∖closed = ∅.
  ⚠ `method_self_kind` returns 0 for FOUR different facts — by-value `self`,
  unresolved, ambiguous, no params. The probe deliberately does not branch on
  it (it checks the receiver at every spelling), which is why the cost stayed
  0; a fix that keys on `sk == 0` would inherit that overload. The probe body
  sits in visit()'s MethodCall arm beside the `method_self_kind` call.

  ── LANDED 2026-08-29. Ledger 365 -> 363; the probe is gone from the tree and
  the rule stands in its place.
  CLOSED SET = {borrowck-uninit-field-access, move-deref-coercion}, i.e. the
  ceiling was REACHED. Predicted-by-name before the build; predicted∖closed = ∅
  and closed∖predicted = ∅. COST measured again on the landed rule: ledger
  363/363, `-L bc` 1794 passed / 0 failed / 2 disabled, and the
  `25_spec|03_ownership|04_advanced` pass selection 190/190. Zero.
  ⚠ RULE 7 — THE CORRECT FIX IS NARROWER THAN THE PROBE. The probe asked at
  EVERY receiver path; the landed rule asks only where the path is EMPTY.
  Measured by hand: `o.i.look()` after `let _x = o.i.a;` already refuses with
  "use of moved field 'o.i.a'" from visit()'s FieldRead arm, so the probe's
  non-empty-path branch bought a SECOND diagnostic for one fact and no row.
  Same ceiling, fewer sentences.
  DELEGATION, NOT A SECOND SPELLING: the partial-move report was HOISTED out of
  `consume` into `report_partial_move(VarState&, name, line)` and called from
  both routes, so the whole-value MOVE and the whole-value USE cannot drift.
  FIXTURES: the two closed programs move to tests/imported/fail/{borrowck,moves}
  with "partially moved" pinned; native pairs are
  tests/logos/fail/bc_recvpartial_{byval,shared}_recv_fail (the two self kinds)
  against tests/logos/pass/bc_recvpartial_{disjoint,reinit}_admit (the eight
  hand-written counter-examples, seven of which fired the armed site).

## recvaddrofpartial
site: src/compiler/borrow_check.cpp::check_live
build: —
measured: 2026-08-29 (OBSERVED, NOT PRICED)
fires: —
ceiling: —
cost: —
verdict: OPEN — the SIBLING SPELLING that `recvpartial` does not reach
note: found while writing `recvpartial`'s counter-examples, and it is the same
  missing observation one spelling over. A whole-value use through an EXPLICIT
  `&` handed to a call is still admitted after a partial move:
    let l = L{origin: P{..}, middle: P{..}};
    let _a = l.origin;
    let n = ro(&l);        → ADMITTED (rc 0, no diagnostic)   ⚠ rustc: E0382
  while `l.look()` — the same whole-value use, spelled as a method call — now
  refuses. `&l` reaches visit()'s AddrOf arm, which asks `check_live`, which
  reads the whole-variable `moved` flag and never `moved_fields`; the landed
  rule sits in the MethodCall arm and does not see this door.
  ⚠ NOT PRICED AND SO NOT CLAIMED: it has no `bc_admits.ledger` row of its own,
  so a ceiling probe would read 0 and that 0 would be corpus silence, not a
  refutation — rule 1 in its second form. The repro above is the evidence; a
  round that funds it must bring its own population (the pass corpus, or a
  hand-built one), not this file's.

## slicepatnull
site: src/compiler/borrow_check.cpp::each_pat_binding_place
build: armed gate build 26 (unarmed baseline 21; probe batch of 2026-08-29)
measured: 2026-08-29
fires: 66
ceiling: 3
cost: 6
verdict: ⛔ STOP AS SPELLED — the largest ceiling in the batch, bought with four spec-pass refusals
note: THE OBSERVATION IS SOUND AND THE SPELLING IS NOT. `each_pat_binding_place`
  gives every sub-pattern of a `PC::Slice` the container's own `base` (no index
  segment, unlike Tuple/Struct which call `sub()`), and those sub-patterns are
  `PC::Wild`, whose arm passes `TypeRef(nullptr)` as the binding TYPE. So the
  landed by-value sub-place move rule (`patbyvalsubmove`) tests
  `is_move_type(nullptr)` and skips EVERY array-pattern binding: `match a {
  [_, _, x] => … }` over `[String; 3]` records no move at all, confirmed by
  `LOGOS_PBSM_TRACE=1` emitting not one line for these three fixtures.
  Coverage map 2026-08-28: `PC::Slice` 111 arrivals, `PC::Wild` 1512.
  PREDICTED borrowck-move-out-from-array-match, --use-match--b, --use-match--t13.
  CLOSED exactly those three, both directions empty — the cleanest aim in the
  batch.
  ⚠ THE COST IS THE PROBE'S SPELLING, NOT THE MECHANISM'S PRICE. "null type ⇒
  move type" also catches struct-shorthand field bindings (82 arrivals) and
  every other null-typed binding, and four of the six costs are SPEC RULES
  (25_spec_pass pat_3, pat_4, pat_7, stmt_2). The correct spelling asks the
  SCRUTINEE for the element type instead of assuming; that is a change to what
  the pattern walk CARRIES, and rule 7 says it will not close the same three.
  NOT FUNDABLE AS MEASURED — a ledger row may not be bought with a legal-program
  refusal.

## destrmove
site: src/compiler/borrow_check.cpp::deref_move_exempt
build: armed gate build 27 (unarmed baseline 21; probe batch of 2026-08-29)
measured: 2026-08-29
fires: 4
ceiling: 2
cost: 1
verdict: the exemption's own NAMED residual, priced — and RULE 4 was declared in advance
note: exemption (4) of `deref_move_exempt` says in its own comment that "a
  destructure that binds a NON-Copy field out of a reference stays admitted
  (tests/imported/admit/nll/move-errors--d keeps its row)". Suppressing it
  closes move-errors--d — the row the comment names — and access-mode-in-
  closures (`let S { v: inner } = *s;`, the same shape through a closure param).
  PREDICTED four: access-mode-in-closures, borrowck-move-error-with-note--a,
  deref-field-pattern-ref-suggestion-issue-146995, move-errors--d.
  CLOSED two; predicted∖closed = {borrowck-move-error-with-note--a,
  deref-field-pattern-…-146995}, closed∖predicted = ∅. Those two are NOT this
  exemption: they move out of a user-`Deref` receiver, where the walk breaks at
  the CALL before any deref arm is reached.
  ⚠ RULE 4, DECLARED BEFORE THE RUN: the coverage map reaches this guard 2944
  times over 8060 runs and TAKES it three times; the probe fired four. A
  ceiling off a population of four bounds almost nothing.
  ⚠ THE COST IS THE EXEMPTION'S OWN PAIRED CONTROL (bc_deref_move_exempt_admit),
  i.e. the exemption is load-bearing exactly where it was documented to be. A
  fix must carry the pattern's move-ness to the destructure temp's `let`, which
  the comment already says is a sema change and its own round.

## callroot
site: src/compiler/borrow_check.cpp::extract_borrow_place
build: armed gate build 18 (unarmed baseline 17; re-priced against the 365-row ledger)
measured: 2026-08-29
fires: 4046842
ceiling: 4
cost: 3
verdict: RE-PRICED (rule 8) — 3 rows on the 447-row ledger of 2026-08-27, 4 on the 365-row one
note: the walk breaks when a place is reached THROUGH A CALL (a user `Deref` /
  `Index` impl, or an autoref'd receiver sema lowered to a plain `Call`), so
  `bp.root` stays empty and `record_borrow` returns on its first line. Rooting
  at the receiver / arg0 with a whole-container path closes:
    borrowck-no-cycle-in-exchange-heap--move-while-refmut-borrowed
    cannot-borrow-index-of-hashmap-in-for · issue-81365-2 · issue-81365-3
  ⚠ THE SET IS THE FINDING, NOT THE COUNT. The `bck.B` gloss invites reading
  the nine `issue-81365-*` rows as ONE mechanism at this site. They are not:
  `callroot` closes TWO of the nine and leaves seven — -4--d2, -4--rd2, -8,
  -9--explicit-deref-call-borrow-then-write, -9--g-method-call-deref, -10, -11.
  A shared symptom is not a shared defect.
  COST 3: 03_ownership_pass_drop_for_loop_item_once (+ its control),
  25_spec_pass_borrow_2. Priced 2026-08-27 in the sixteen-hypothesis batch and
  never recorded outside that commit message; this is its first record here.
  ── 2026-08-29b: SUPERSEDED BY `callrootref`, which keeps all four rows and
  takes the corpus cost to 0 by hopping only through REFERENCE-RETURNING calls.
  The hand-written legal program that declined this probe still refuses under
  BOTH spellings (re-run this round; see `callrootref`), so neither is fundable
  and the blocker is sema's deref-mode selection, not this arm.

## refwhole
site: src/compiler/borrow_check.cpp::extract_borrow_place
build: armed gate build 19 (unarmed baseline 17; re-priced against the 365-row ledger)
measured: 2026-08-29
fires: 2348033
ceiling: 1
cost: 600
verdict: ⛔ DEAD — 600 legal programs for one row, and `recvfieldpath` buys that row at 0
note: a place reached THROUGH a reference is recorded as a FIELD borrow of the
  REFERENCE BINDING, so two projections of one ref never overlap. Collapsing to
  the whole root closes issue-82032 and refuses 600 legal programs across
  02_semantic_core, the bc pass corpus and the spec dirs. `recvfieldpath`
  closes the same single row at COST 0 by asking the path maps instead of
  destroying the paths. Recorded so the collapse is not re-proposed.

## ⚠ TWO PROBE RULES PULL AGAINST EACH OTHER

── ⚠ TWO RULES PULL AGAINST EACH OTHER, AND ONE PROBE IS NOT ENOUGH ────────
"Put probe::on() FIRST in any &&" exists so a zero means the site was never
reached rather than the redirect never matching. But putting it first makes
the count the population of the OUTER condition, not of the mechanism.
MEASURED 2026-08-29: `dwatunwrap` reported 467 fires — every `DerefWrite` —
while the subset it was actually about, the `AddrOfTemp` spelling, went
uncounted. Its ceiling of 0 was then read against the wrong denominator.

So a mechanism with an inner predicate needs TWO names, not one:
    if (logos::probe::on("x_site") && inner_predicate(e)) {
        (void)logos::probe::on("x_match");   // the subset that matters
        ...
    }
`x_site` says the code path is live; `x_match` says how often the mechanism's
own condition held. A zero on the second over a large first is a refutation;
a zero on both is an unreached site; and only the pair can tell them apart.


⚠ THIS NOTE LIVES HERE AND NOT IN `probe.hpp`, AND THAT IS THE SECOND LESSON.
I wrote it into the header first — "put the rule beside the thing it qualifies"
— and `probe.hpp` is COMPILED. Twelve lines of prose, no code, shifted the line
tables of a RelWithDebInfo build, changed the binary hash, and invalidated all
58,703 verdicts in the measurement store: a green `L4 bc` from minutes earlier
suddenly described a compiler that no longer existed. This file was created an
hour before, for exactly this, and I did not use it.

**Prose about probes goes here. `probe.hpp` carries only what the compiler needs.**

# ROUND 2026-08-29b — G1 AND G2 RE-ATTRIBUTED BY MEASUREMENT

Eight probe names, five source edits, ONE build (`scripts/probe-batch.sh`).
L1 rc=0 with nothing armed, so the batch was inert. The three `callroot`-family
names and the two `mutstatic` names are RULE 9 PAIRS: an observational name
counting the OUTER population beside the mechanism's own name counting the
INNER one, because `probe::on()` first in an `&&` counts the wrong denominator
and `probe::on()` last cannot tell a false predicate from an unreached site.

## G1 IS NOT ONE MECHANISM — IT IS FOUR, AND ONLY ONE IS FUNDABLE

The seven rows glossed "mut-ness is asked of the ROOT BINDING, never of the last
hop" were compiled by hand, one variable at a time, BEFORE any probe. They are
four different missing observations:

  G1a  a COMPOUND assignment never asks writability at all — 2 rows
       issue-85765, issue-93093.  ONE TOKEN APART, measured:
         let rofl: &V = &mut t;  rofl.n = 1i64;   -> REFUSED
         let rofl: &V = &mut t;  rofl.n += 1i64;  -> ADMITTED
       `lower_place_compound_assign` calls `place_write_supported` and never
       `check_place_writable`, which the plain-assign path calls. -> opeqwritable.
  G1b  `mut` in a PATTERN / on a PARAM has no bit to read — 1 row
       borrowck-ref-mut-of-imm--ref-mut-of-imm.  MEASURED:
         fn d(x: Option<i64>) { match x { Some(ref mut v) => … } }  -> ADMITTED
         let x: Option<i64>;   match x { Some(ref mut v) => … }     -> REFUSED
       The coverage map prices this hatch exactly: of 1,061,549 `&mut` arrivals
       at `take_borrow_whole_`, `is_mut_binding` is true 14,237 times and
       `param_names_` exempts 1,047,220 — 98.7% of every mut borrow in the tree.
       NOT PROBED: refusing that population is a legal-program refusal machine.
       The prerequisite is already named at `recvmutbind` — a by-value-`mut` bit
       on the pattern/param schema, set by sema. Same blocker, second row.
  G1c  `&mut <immutable module static>` is never asked — 2 rows (1 predicted)
       -> mutstaticborrow.
  G1d  a deref hop through an OWNING container drops the binding-mut question —
       2 rows: borrow-immutable-deref-box, borrowck-access-permissions--c.
       -> nomutskip, and its two costs are legal programs. STOP.
  and cannot-borrow-index-of-hashmap-in-for, the seventh, is a G2 row: it closes
  under callrootref, not under anything mut-shaped.

## G2's HOP IS THE RIGHT IDEA AT THE RIGHT PLACE AND STILL CANNOT BE BOUGHT

Narrowing the hop to REFERENCE-RETURNING calls keeps all four of `callroot`'s
rows and takes its corpus cost from 3 to 0 (`callrootref`). It does NOT rescue
the hand-written program that declined `callroot` on 2026-08-28 — re-verified on
today's tree under each of the three names, identical diagnostic each time:
    match *x { Cycle::Node(ref mut y) => { y.a = Box::new(2i64); } }   // legal
    -> "cannot borrow 'x.0' as mutable: 'x' is behind a `&` reference"
The reason is upstream of the walker: sema lowers a `match *box` scrutinee
through the SHARED `Deref::deref` even when a sub-pattern binds `ref mut`, so
`cross()` records a `&` crossing and record_borrow's E0596 gate fires on a
program that needs `DerefMut`. Until the scrutinee's deref MODE follows the
pattern's binding mode, every hop through that call refuses this program.

site: src/compiler/borrow_check.cpp::extract_borrow_place
build: armed gate build 40 (unarmed baseline 33; probe batch of 2026-08-29b)
measured: 2026-08-29
fires: 1131
ceiling: 0
cost: 0
verdict: OBSERVATIONAL — the OUTER population of the call-hop arm, and it changes nothing
note: RULE 9's missing half. `callroot`'s condition is
  `probe::on("callroot") && (kind == MethodCall || Call || AddrOfTemp)`, so its
  4,046,842 fires count every arrival at the arm and say nothing about the
  subset a NARROWED hop would take. This name sits alone at the top of the arm
  and counts arrivals without changing a verdict: 1131 over the 363-row ledger,
  against `callrootref`'s 355. So the reference-returning predicate holds on
  31% of the arm's traffic, and `callrootref`'s numbers are read against 355 —
  not against 1131, and not against 4 million.
  ⚠ The coverage map cannot supply this number: over the 8060-run population it
  counts 22,933,255 arrivals at the `} else { break; }` that swallows the call
  kinds together with every other unhandled expression kind. Only a name at the
  arm separates them.

## callrootref
site: src/compiler/borrow_check.cpp::extract_borrow_place
build: armed gate build 34 (unarmed baseline 33; probe batch of 2026-08-29b)
measured: 2026-08-29
fires: 355
ceiling: 4
cost: 0
verdict: ⛔ DECLINED — the corpus cost went 3 → 0 and the LEGAL PROGRAM that declined `callroot` still refuses
note: `callroot` hops to the receiver/arg0 of ANY Call/MethodCall/AddrOfTemp.
  This narrows it to calls whose RESULT IS A REFERENCE (`is_ref_kind`, the same
  predicate `cross()` already uses) — a call returning an owned value is a
  TEMPORARY, not a place, and rooting its borrow at arg0 is what refused legal
  programs. MEASURED: same ceiling, same four rows, and the corpus cost drops
  from `callroot`'s 3 to 0.
  PREDICTED borrowck-no-cycle-in-exchange-heap--move-while-refmut-borrowed,
  cannot-borrow-index-of-hashmap-in-for, issue-81365-2, issue-81365-3.
  CLOSED exactly those four; predicted∖closed = ∅ and closed∖predicted = ∅.
  ⚠ AND COST 0 IS STILL NOT A SAFETY CLAIM — RULE 5, AND IT BIT. The program
  that declined `callroot` on 2026-08-28 is not in any corpus, so it cannot
  appear in a COST column. Re-run by hand on today's tree under `callroot`,
  `callrootref` AND `callfldw`, identical diagnostic under all three:
      let mut x: Box<Cycle> = Box::new(Cycle::Node(NodeD{a: Box::new(1i64)}));
      match *x { Cycle::Node(ref mut y) => { y.a = Box::new(2i64); } … }
      → "cannot borrow 'x.0' as mutable: 'x' is behind a `&` reference"
  legal Rust, refused. The narrowing does not touch it, because the defect is
  UPSTREAM OF THE WALKER: sema lowers a `match *box` scrutinee through the
  SHARED `Deref::deref` even when a sub-pattern binds `ref mut`, so `cross()`
  records a `&` crossing and record_borrow's E0596 gate fires. THE PREREQUISITE,
  named so the next round does not re-derive it: the scrutinee's deref MODE must
  follow the pattern's binding mode (`DerefMut::deref_mut` when any sub-pattern
  is `ref mut`). Ten counter-examples were run under each name; the other nine
  stayed rc 0, seven of them with the probe firing (7, 7, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1).

## callfldw
site: src/compiler/borrow_check.cpp::extract_borrow_place
build: armed gate build 39 (unarmed baseline 33; probe batch of 2026-08-29b)
measured: 2026-08-29
fires: 1299
ceiling: 4
cost: 0
verdict: ⛔ REFUTED AS A COMPOSITION — predicted 11 rows, closed the same 4 as `callrootref` alone
note: THE HYPOTHESIS WAS THE "NULL RESULT THROUGH A BROKEN CHANNEL" SHAPE, and
  it was wrong. `callroot` closes 2 of the 9 `issue-81365-*` rows; the other 7
  differ in exactly one property — the hop lands with an EMPTY path (a whole-`c`
  / whole-`self` borrow) where -2/-3 land with path "container". `dwnoidx` had
  already priced the place-write reader at 0, but that zero was taken with NO
  hop armed, i.e. against a channel that deposits nothing. So: arm both.
  This name arms the reference-narrowed hop AND drops the `saw_index` conjunct
  at the DerefWrite exclusivity gate, in one process.
  PREDICTED 11: `callrootref`'s four PLUS issue-81365-4--d2, -4--rd2, -8,
  -9--explicit-deref-call-borrow-then-write, -9--g-method-call-deref, -10, -11.
  CLOSED 4. closed∖predicted = ∅; predicted∖closed = ALL SEVEN.
  ⚠ TWO SITES, ONE NAME — declared in advance and the sum decomposes exactly:
  1299 = 355 (`callrootref`'s site) + 944 (`dwnoidx`'s site), both of which were
  measured separately in the same build. Neither site's liveness rests on this
  aggregate.
  ── AND THE ONE-VARIABLE ISOLATION SAYS WHERE THE SEVEN ACTUALLY LIVE. Three
  programs, same struct, run against the armed binary:
      let r: &C = &c;        c.b = 9;   → REFUSED TODAY, unarmed
        ("cannot borrow 'c.b' as mutable: 'c' has shared borrows")
      let first = &c.tf;     c.cf = 9;  → ADMITTED under callfldw (7 hop fires)
        (`tf` reached through a user `Deref` — the -4--d2 shape)
      let first = &c.t.tf;   c.cf = 9;  → ADMITTED (legal: disjoint fields)
  The whole-root-borrow vs field-write direction is ALREADY CLOSED by an
  existing reader — line 1 proves it — so the read side was never the hole and
  `dwnoidx`'s zero was an honest zero. The hop RUNS on line 2 (7 fires) and the
  borrow is still not seen, so nothing recorded it: `visit()`'s AddrOfTemp arm
  records a whole-root borrow only when the place is "reached through DEREFS
  ALONE" (the reborrow peel), or `index_in_chain`, or the path is non-empty, or
  `slice_view_base_`. A place reached through a user `Deref` CALL satisfies NONE
  of them, and the arm's own comment says why the obvious widening was reverted:
  "recording a whole-root borrow whenever the path came back empty also fires
  for a plain AddrOfTemp(VarRef) — every method autoref — so `it.next()` in a
  loop conflicted with itself and liblogos-lang stopped building".
  ⇒ NEXT PROBE, NAMED: `callindexchain` — have `extract_borrow_place` set
  `index_in_chain = true` when it hops a reference-returning call. The
  whole-container semantics of that hop IS the index step's, the AddrOfTemp arm
  already records unconditionally for `index_in_chain`, and the flag does not
  fire for a bare `AddrOfTemp(VarRef)`. One flag, and it is the DEPOSIT side —
  not the walker (which already gives the right root) and not the reader (which
  already refuses the same shape without a deref).

## dwnoidx
site: src/compiler/borrow_check.cpp::visit_stmt
build: armed gate build 36 (unarmed baseline 33; probe batch of 2026-08-29b)
measured: 2026-08-29
fires: 944
ceiling: 0
cost: 0
verdict: RE-PRICED (rule 8) — 0/0 on the 363-row ledger, as on the 400-row one
note: the place-write exclusivity refusal is gated on the AddrOfTemp walk having
  crossed an IndexRead/SliceIndex, so `s.f = v` / `t.0 = v` are exempt. Dropping
  the conjunct changed nothing on 2026-08-28 (189 fires, 400 rows) and changes
  nothing now (944 fires, 363 rows). Coverage map: 19,193 arrivals, `saw_index`
  true 6,518 — ~12,675 rooted place writes per pass really are exempt.
  ⚠ AND THE ZERO IS NOW EXPLAINED, not merely repeated. Isolated by hand on the
  armed binary: `let r = &c; c.b = 9;` is refused TODAY with no probe armed
  ("cannot borrow 'c.b' as mutable: 'c' has shared borrows"), so the whole-root
  vs field-write question already has a reader and this gate would only add a
  second diagnostic for the same fact. See `callfldw`.

## nomutskip
site: src/compiler/borrow_check.cpp::take_borrow_whole_
build: armed gate build 35 (unarmed baseline 33; probe batch of 2026-08-29b)
measured: 2026-08-29
fires: 25
ceiling: 2
cost: 2
verdict: ⛔ STOP — EXACT aim, and both costs are legal programs
note: THE EXEMPTION IN THE ABUSE DIRECTION. `take_borrow_whole_`'s binding-mut
  arm is skipped whenever the caller passes `skip_mut_binding_check`. Ignoring
  the flag closes exactly the two G1d rows. ISOLATED ON ONE VARIABLE first:
      let x: i64 = 3;          f(&mut x);   → REFUSED "not declared as mut"
      let x: Box<i64> = …;     f(&mut *x);  → ADMITTED
      let x: Box<i64> = …;     let y: &mut i64 = &mut *x;  → ADMITTED
  and the borrow IS recorded (two of them collide, and moving `x` while one is
  live is refused) — so the loan lands and only the binding question is dropped.
  PREDICTED borrow-immutable-deref-box, borrowck-access-permissions--c-mut-
  borrow-deref-box. CLOSED exactly those two, both directions empty.
  ⚠ COST 2, and they are the exemption's own reason for existing:
  02_semantic_core_pass_bc_genrecv_constructed_legals_admit and
  02_semantic_core_pass_zone_mut_thin_source_admits_generic. A ledger row may
  not be bought with a legal-program refusal.
  ⚠ RULE 4, DECLARED IN ADVANCE: the coverage map reaches this guard 1,061,549
  times and the hatch is taken only 76 of them; the probe fired 25 over the
  ledger. A ceiling off that population bounds very little.
  ⚠ AND THE HATCH IS NOT WHERE THE PERMISSIVENESS IS. In the same 1,061,549
  arrivals `param_names_` exempts 1,047,220 — 98.7% — because a param carries no
  mut bit. That is G1b, and it needs the sema bit `recvmutbind` already named.

## opeqwritable
site: src/compiler/sema_stmt.cpp::lower_place_compound_assign
build: armed gate build 37 (unarmed baseline 33; probe batch of 2026-08-29b)
measured: 2026-08-29
fires: 15
ceiling: 2
cost: 0
verdict: ✓ FUND THIS — a compound assignment never asks writability, and the sibling call already exists
note: ONE TOKEN APART, MEASURED BY HAND BEFORE THE PROBE, four programs:
      let rofl: &V = &mut t;      rofl.n = 1i64;   → REFUSED
      let rofl: &V = &mut t;      rofl.n += 1i64;  → ADMITTED
      fn bar(self: &S) { self.foo = 2i64; }        → REFUSED
      fn bar(self: &S) { self.foo += 1i64; }       → ADMITTED
  The refusing spelling goes through `check_place_writable(place_node)`, called
  by the plain place-assign path. `lower_place_compound_assign` calls
  `place_write_supported` — "can the address machinery lower this" — and never
  asks the writability question at all. Its VarRef sibling
  (`lower_compound_assign`) DOES ask, via `lookup_is_mut`; the tree's own
  comment there records the gap ("the field spelling is UNCHECKED by this rule
  and would need its own"). This probe adds the ONE MISSING CALL.
  PREDICTED issue-85765, issue-93093. CLOSED exactly those two; predicted∖closed
  = ∅ and closed∖predicted = ∅.
  ⚠ AND `dwatunwrap` PRICED THE SAME TWO ROWS AT 0 ON 2026-08-29, at the borrow-
  check DerefWrite door. Two spellings of one question; the borrow-check one is
  refuted and the sema one closes both. Its own note left exactly this residual
  open — "or the compound `+=` spelling takes a door that is not DerefWrite at
  all" — and that is the answer.
  ⚠ COST 0 WITH COUNTER-EXAMPLES READ, not corpus silence: `fn bump(v:&mut V){
  v.n += 1; }`, `t.n += 1` on a mut local, `a[0] += 5` on a mut array, and
  `fn bar(self:&mut S){ self.foo += 1; }` all stay rc 0 AND each fired the armed
  site (1, 1, 1, 2 fires). 15 fires over the ledger — RULE 4 applies to the
  ceiling, not to the counter-examples.
  ⚠ RULE 7 WARNING FOR WHOEVER LANDS IT: the probe calls `check_place_writable`
  unconditionally, which also refuses `s.n += 1` on a non-`mut` local `s`. That
  is correct Rust and costs nothing here, but it is a SECOND fact the probe buys
  along with the two rows; a landed rule should predict both or ask only the
  `&`-reference half.

## mutstaticsite

measured: 2026-08-29
fires: 3
ceiling: 0
cost: 0
verdict: OBSERVATIONAL — the OUTER population of `&mut <module static>`
note: RULE 9's other half. `mutstaticborrow` sits AFTER the `!module_static_muts_`
  predicate so its own count is the non-`mut` SUBSET; this one counts every
  arrival at the `is_module_static_unshadowed` branch of ADDR_OF_MUT. 3 arrivals
  over the ledger, of which `mutstaticborrow` fires on 2 — so exactly one is a
  genuine `static mut`. MEASURED on the counter-example too: `static mut SY;
  unsafe { &mut SY }` fires `mutstaticsite` once and `mutstaticborrow` zero
  times. That zero is the exemption HOLDING, and without this name it would be
  indistinguishable from an unreached site.

## mutstaticborrow

ceiling: 2
cost: 0
verdict: ✓ `&mut <immutable static>` is assumed, never asked — and it closed a row nobody nominated
note: the branch's own comment says "`&mut STATIC` (a `static mut`) IS the
  global's address" and nothing checks that the static is `mut`. ISOLATED, one
  variable:
      static SX: i64 = 1;  let y: &mut i64 = &mut SX;  → ADMITTED
      let sx: i64 = 1;     let y: &mut i64 = &mut sx;  → REFUSED
  and the WRITE half is already asked — `SX = 2;` is refused ("assignment to
  immutable variable"). Only the BORROW half was missing.
  PREDICTED borrowck-access-permissions--b-mut-borrow-of-static. CLOSED that AND
  issue-42344 — a `bck.NEW` row nobody nominated, and it is the same three lines
  (`static TAB: i64 = 5; let r: &mut i64 = &mut TAB;`). predicted∖closed = ∅.
  ⚠ RULE 4 IN FORCE: 2 fires off an outer population of 3 (`mutstaticsite`).
  A ceiling of 2 off a population of 3 bounds almost nothing about the SET.
  ⚠ AND THE ABUSE DIRECTION IS STILL OPEN AT THIS SITE, unmeasured: the branch
  also hands out `&mut SY` for a genuine `static mut` with no `unsafe`
  requirement, while the WRITE path does demand one. Not this round's row.

verdict: RE-PRICED (rule 8) — still 0/0, now on the 363-row ledger
note: last priced 2026-08-27 at 314 fires against the 447-row ledger. The
  population more than tripled and the answer did not move. Priced FREE: the
  probe was already compiled into the baseline binary, so this cost one armed
  run and no build. It was re-asked because `*x` on a `Box` lowers to a RAW-
  pointer deref (measured: `*x = 5` says "write through raw pointer requires
  unsafe context"), which made the raw-ptr bail a candidate for G1d's two rows.
  It is not: those two close under `nomutskip` and not here.
