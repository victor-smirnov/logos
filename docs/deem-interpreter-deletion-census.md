# The Deem interpreter deletion (P5) — call-graph blocker, fixture census, loss ledger

STATUS: **the deletion is REFUSED as scoped.** This file is the measurement that refuses it and the
census that makes the next attempt cheap. It decides nothing about whether the capability should go —
that is Victor's call, and §6 is the list he needs to make it.

MEASURED at `9ebb6110` (the tree this file is committed into). Everything below is a grep or a read of
a named symbol; no line numbers are cited, because they move. Reproduce any row with
`grep -rnE "^(pub )?(fn|struct) <name>\b" stdlib/`.

Scope statement being tested (P5 as written): delete `stdlib/mem/deem/{check,exec,eval,query}.logos`
(4713 lines as written), keep `incr.logos` and `incr_rec.logos`, triage ~80 fixtures.
⚠ `eval.logos` no longer exists (the template port, `8c5ad0ea`); the three surviving named files are
974+1450+963 = 3387 lines today. §2 carries the re-measured table.

---

## 1. THE BLOCKER — three independent refusals

### 1a. The four doomed files are the SUBSTRATE of `incr.logos` / `incr_rec.logos`

Every symbol below has exactly ONE definition in `stdlib/`:

| symbol | sole definition | in the cut? |
|---|---|---|
| `qplan_new` `check_rexpr` `struct QPlan` | `stdlib/mem/deem/check.logos` | yes |
| `relctx_new` `exec_root` `rt_key_hash` `h_step` `struct RelCtx` `struct OutTab` `ts_scan` | `stdlib/mem/deem/exec.logos` | yes |
| `struct Query` `struct QRows` | `stdlib/mem/deem/query.logos` | yes |
| `rbinds_new` `eval_sexpr` `struct RBinds` `struct Tpl` `chk_new` `sx_of` `struct Chk` | `stdlib/mem/deem/tpl.logos` | **NO** — ported out of `eval.logos`/`check.logos`/`exec.logos`, survives the cut |

⚠ The last row USED to read `eval.logos` + `check.logos`, i.e. doomed. The port (`8c5ad0ea`) moved
those seven names to a file that is not in the cut, so the blocker below now rests on the first three
rows ONLY. `chk_new` / `sx_of` / `Chk` are no longer evidence for it.

Real (non-comment) call/type uses in the two files P5 says it keeps — counted by
`grep -cE "\b(qplan_new|chk_new|sx_of|check_rexpr|relctx_new|exec_root|rt_key_hash|h_step|rbinds_new|eval_sexpr)\("`:

* `stdlib/mem/deem/incr.logos` — **44**
* `stdlib/mem/deem/incr_rec.logos` — **25**

Re-counted over the DOOMED names only (`qplan_new|check_rexpr|relctx_new|exec_root|rt_key_hash|h_step`,
i.e. dropping the six that the port moved to the surviving `tpl.logos`): **19** and **21**. The refusal
does not depend on the difference — 19 and 21 are still unsatisfiable after the cut — but the 44/25
figures are no longer a measurement OF THE CUT and must not be quoted as one.

plus the type uses (`&Query`, `QPlan`, `RelCtx`, `QRows` in `IncrRec::snapshot`, `ir_check`,
`dred`, `epoch`; `Chk` now resolves to `tpl.logos` and survives).

And the loop closes at the entry point: `Query { … }` is CONSTRUCTED at exactly one site in the tree —
inside `Query::compile` in `stdlib/mem/deem/query.logos`. `impl Query` exists in three files
(`query.logos`, `incr.logos` for `Query::incremental`, `incr_rec.logos` for `Query::incremental_rec`),
so deleting `query.logos` removes the only way to OBTAIN an `IncrJoin` or an `IncrRec` even if they
still compiled.

⇒ There is no 4713-line cut. The cut is the whole dynamic + dynamic-incremental tier, or nothing.

### 1b. `mapping_state.logos` is `impl EngineState for IncrRec`

`stdlib/mem/deem/mapping_state.logos` (92 lines, not on any list) is nothing but
`pub trait EngineState`, `impl EngineState for IncrRec`, and the four materializers
`deem_state_trace` / `deem_state_epochs` / `deem_state_tail` / `deem_state_controls`, each taking
`e: &IncrRec`. It dies with `incr_rec.logos`.

⚠ CORRECTION (verification pass, measured at `8cf79102`): the compiler does NOT merely lose vocabulary.
`SemaChecker::seed_builtin_source_impls` in `src/compiler/sema_expr.cpp` hard-names the fallback seed
`source_impls_["IncrRec"]` → `EngineState` rels `trace`/`epochs`/`tail`/`controls`, materializers
`deem_state_trace`/`_epochs`/`_tail`/`_controls`, module `logos.mem.deem`. The seed is CONTENT-guarded
(`const bool have_incr = source_impls_.count("IncrRec") > 0; … if (have_incr) return;`) — it defers only
while `mapping_state.logos` declares them. Delete that file and the guard flips OFF, so the C++ fallback
RE-REGISTERS four materializers that no longer exist. The seed must be removed in the same change.
(`writ_graph_edges`, seeded the same way for `Writ`, survives.)

This one bites UPWARD into the static tier: `wql_engine_source_e2e` declares `pub deem encounters(e: &IncrRec)`
— a STATIC `deem` item whose source type is the dynamic engine (ADR 0016 M5, case S). The engine-as-a-source
capability is a static-tier feature that cannot outlive `IncrRec`. `stdlib/mem/wql/params.logos` carries the
comment that names it (on `native_use_at`, "Any `IncrRec` engine-source param present?"); the mechanism itself
is generic (natspec `rel_mod`), so the compiler does not break — the VOCABULARY does.

### 1c. the Trama TEMPLATE engine lived in the cut — RESOLVED by the port at `8c5ad0ea`

`pub struct Tpl`, `Tpl::compile`, `Tpl::render` USED to live in `eval.logos` and reach `check.logos`
(`check_stmts`, `cbinds_new`, `chk_new`, `simplify_all`, `chk_err`) and `eval.logos`
(`render_stmts`, `rbinds_new`). They now live, whole, in `stdlib/mem/deem/tpl.logos`
(`eval.logos` no longer exists), so this refusal no longer blocks the cut. It is kept because the
REASON stands: this is a separate SHIPPED public capability, not part of the Datalog
arc: five fixtures use `Tpl` and never mention `Query` (`query_rtval_ops_e2e`, `query_tpl_udf_e2e`,
`query_trama_arith_err_e2e`, `query_trama_dynamic_e2e`, `query_trama_typecheck_e2e`).
`stdlib/mem/wql/trama.logos` and `trama_render.logos` both describe themselves as the STATIC sibling of
"the `Tpl::compile` runtime (logos.std.deem)" — co-designed, not superseded. The static tier never
replaced runtime templating and has no plan to.

## 2. The cut, if it is taken anyway

| file | lines | why it is in the cut |
|---|---|---|
Line counts RE-MEASURED at `8c5ad0ea` (`wc -l`), after the template port shrank `check.logos` and
`exec.logos` and deleted `eval.logos`:

| file | lines | why it is in the cut |
|---|---|---|
| `stdlib/mem/deem/check.logos` | 974 | on the list (was 1672; the EL/template checker left for `tpl.logos`) |
| `stdlib/mem/deem/exec.logos` | 1450 | on the list (was 1472; `eval_sx` left). Also holds `ts_scan`, the dynamic graph walker |
| `stdlib/mem/deem/query.logos` | 963 | on the list |
| `stdlib/mem/deem/incr.logos` | 1978 | §1a; also holds `pub struct FactStore`, `IncrJoin` |
| `stdlib/mem/deem/incr_rec.logos` | 1466 | §1a; `IncrRec` |
| `stdlib/mem/deem/mapping_state.logos` | 92 | §1b |
| `stdlib/lcm/deem/facthistory.logos` | 514 | `FactHistory::new` composes `FactStore::new`; sole non-test constructor of `FactStore` |
| **total** | **7437** | |

`stdlib/mem/deem/tpl.logos` (1339) is NOT in this table and NOT in the cut: it is the template engine,
ported out of `eval.logos`/`check.logos`/`exec.logos` at `8c5ad0ea` precisely so it outlives them
(§1c). `eval.logos` no longer exists.

`stdlib/mem/deem/deem.logos` (1279) SURVIVES as a file — it holds `RtVal`, `rt_kind`, `rt_eq`,
`SchemaCatalog`, `QEnv` — but its `QEnv` half loses every consumer: `QEnv` is named in real code only in
the eight deem files above (`stdlib/mem/wql/rexpr_walk.logos`'s single `QEnv` mention is a comment), and
`bind_source_erased` / `bind_node_erased` / `bind_source_tree` are `QEnv` methods with no other caller.
The residue inside `deem.logos` is NOT measured here.

Outside `tests/` and outside the deem package there are ZERO real uses: every hit in
`stdlib/mem/wql/{catalog_macro,el,lower,mapping_item,plan_walker,rexpr_walk,writ_graph,trama,trama_render}.logos`,
`tools/peg_gen_cpp/CMakeLists.txt` and `tools/peg_gen_cpp/oracle/run_wql.sh` is a COMMENT.
(`resolve_source` in `plan_walker.logos` is a local definition with a different signature, not a
reference to `check.logos`'s.) `catalog_macro.logos` really does `use logos.mem.deem`, but only for
`SchemaCatalog::from_static` — which survives.

---

## 3. Fixture census — 82 files

Population: `grep -rlE "Query::run|Query::compile|\.incremental\(\)|incremental_rec\(\)|Tpl::compile|Tpl::render" tests/logos/`
= 81 `tests/logos/pass/*.logos` + `tests/logos/rtval_domain_gate.sh`.

⚠ **THE POPULATION IS INCOMPLETE, and by construction.** That grep names the interpreter's ENTRY POINTS,
not the SYMBOLS in the §2 cut. Re-greped over the cut's own symbols
(`FactStore|FactHistory|IncrRec|IncrJoin|EngineState|deem_state_*|Tpl|QRows|Query|RelCtx|QPlan|ts_scan|…`),
`tests/logos/` yields 92 files, and **three of the extra ten are real, non-comment uses that are NOT in
the table below**: `query_incr_factstore_unit` (`FactStore::new`), `query_incr_factstore_epochs`
(`FactHistory::new` ×2), `query_incr_factstore_float_identity_unit` (`FactStore::new` + `FactHistory::new`,
and it reaches `fs_key_enc`). `FactStore` is defined once, in `incr.logos`; `FactHistory` once, in
`facthistory.logos` — both in the cut. All three die and none is censused, so §6 L5's witness list and
§7's registry prediction are both three short. The other seven extra files are comment-only hits.
The census total is therefore **85 affected test files, not 82**, and the correct population rule is
"grep the CUT's symbols", not "grep the entry points".

Classes:

* **A — dies with its subject.** No static arm; the file's subject IS the interpreter or the
  dynamic-incremental engine. Deleting it is correct, not a weakening.
* **B — edit.** A real static arm in the SAME file (a `deem` item is declared, or emitted-handle
  functions `<q>_apply`/`_retract`/`_epoch`/`_snapshot` are called). Drop the interpreter arm, keep the
  rest — and then check per fixture that what is left still BITES.
* **C — loss.** No static arm, and the subject is not the interpreter but a cell the interpreter is
  merely the vehicle for. §5 says what the static tier would have to gain.
* **D — capability, not fixture** (`wql_engine_source_e2e` only): §1b.
* **G — gate to re-pin** (`rtval_domain_gate.sh`): §7.
* **K** flag — the file carries a `⚠ KNOWN-WRONG` pin: an expectation that IS a recorded open defect,
  beside the value it OUGHT to give. Deleting the file deletes the record of the defect, so every K row
  must be transcribed into the owning arc BEFORE anything is removed.

⚠ **CORRECTION to the earlier triage.** A `grep` for `_apply(` over these fixtures is a FALSE SIGNAL:
eleven files define local helpers named `src_apply`, `nasty_apply`, `edge_apply` and have no static arm
at all. Measured, the static-arm population is 25 files, not the 17 previously listed, and the overlap is
partial — `query_incr_join_e2e`, `query_incr_join_fuzz`, `query_incr_nasty_{join,sssp,tc}`,
`query_incr_prov_e2e`, `query_incr_sssp_fuzz`, `query_incr_tc_fuzz`, `query_incr_tc_retract`,
`wql_incr_rec_agg_retract_lattice`, `wql_incr_rec_dred_error_window` were all misfiled as B and are A.

`interp` = count of `Query::run|Query::compile|.incremental()|incremental_rec()` lines.
`static arm` = the `deem` items declared in-file, or `handle` for emitted-handle calls.

Totals: **A 31 · B 25 · C 24 · D 1 · G 1**. K flag on 7 files (4, 62, 63, 64, 65, 71, 78).

⚠ The class column is a judgement over a measured signature (interp count, declared `deem` items,
emitted-handle calls) plus each file's own header block, which every one of the 81 carries and states its
subject in. It is NOT a full read of 82 files. The B rows in particular still owe the per-fixture
"does what is left still bite" check that no one has done.

## 4. What survives on the static side

Named, so the next attempt does not have to re-find them:
`stdlib/mem/wql/` keeps the whole compile path — `el.logos` (`el_ty_stored`, `el_ty_stored_of`,
`el_wrap_ord_key`), `params.logos` (`stamp_rel_incr_shape`, `native_use_at`), `rexpr_walk.logos`
(`emit_scc_od_fns`), `writ_graph.logos` (`writ_graph_edges`), `trama_render.logos`, `codegen.logos`,
`lower.logos`, `plan_walker.logos`, `catalog_macro.logos`. `stdlib/mem/deem/deem.logos` keeps `RtVal`,
`rt_kind`, `rt_eq`, `SchemaCatalog`.

The static emitted surface is `<q>_apply(&mut h, __src, __w, <params>)` / `<q>_retract` /
`<q>_epoch` / `<q>_snapshot` over caller-supplied typed delta rows. There is no presence set, no content
keying, no arena and no journal on that side — which is why `FactStore` (defined in `incr.logos`) has no
static counterpart to move to.

---

## 5. Class-C requirements — what the static tier would have to GAIN

Stated as symbols, so each is a task and not a wish.

**C1 — the value domain in the dynamic tier** (rows 14, 58, 59, 61, 62, 63, 64, 65, 66, 67, 79, 80).
These pin that a column's own type governs comparison, ordering and accumulation at every position.
The static tier already has the type: `el_ty_stored` / `el_ty_stored_of` (`stdlib/mem/wql/el.logos`) and
the wrap key `el_wrap_ord_key`. What is missing is a STATIC fixture family that asks the same question of
emitted code at the same seams — order key, aggregate accumulator, scalar arithmetic inside an aggregate
argument, and the aggregate OUT-NAME's signedness. Model: `wql_domain_static_extremes` already exists and
is exactly the right shape; it needs siblings `..._static_order_{a,b,c}`, `..._static_carrier_positions`,
`..._static_u64_sum_{accumulator,scalar_arith}`. Until they exist, deleting rows 61–67 and 79–80 removes
the only place the value-domain arc's open defects are written down (see the K flag).

**C2 — runtime templates** (rows 49, 52, 53, 54, 55). There is no static substitute and none was ever
designed: `stdlib/mem/wql/trama_render.logos` is the metaprog-side sibling and says so, naming the
`Tpl::compile` runtime as the other half. To keep the capability, `Tpl` / `Tpl::compile` / `Tpl::render`
plus their dependencies (`check_stmts`, `cbinds_new`, `simplify_all`, `chk_err`, `render_stmts`,
`rbinds_new`, `eval_sexpr`, `RBinds`, `Chk`) had to be MOVED out of `eval.logos`/`check.logos` into a
template-only module before either file is deleted. That is a port, not a triage. **DONE at `8c5ad0ea`**
— `stdlib/mem/deem/tpl.logos`, plus `eval_sx` (which this list missed; it lived in `exec.logos` and is
the sole `RtVal::Error` → `chk_fail_p` boundary) and `check_expr` / `check_root` / `src_elem_ty` /
`bin_op_name` / `chk_new` / `chk_fail` / `chk_bad` / `chk_fail_p` / `sx_of` / `CB_CAP` / `impl CBinds`.
Rows 49, 52, 53, 54, 55 are therefore no longer C-class losses.

**C3 — lenient / erased sources** (rows 39, 40) — **RULED: WITHDRAWN, and the withdrawal is now PINNED.**
`QEnv::bind_source_erased` and `QEnv::bind_node_erased` (in `deem.logos`, which survives) have no caller
after the cut and no static analogue: a `deem` item's source is a typed slice, so there is nothing to be
lenient about.

*What was measured, 2026-08-09* (each claim re-grepped, since this document is pinned by no gate):

- **The capability is LIVE but TEST-ONLY.** `bind_source_erased` / `bind_node_erased` have ZERO callers in
  `stdlib/` and ZERO in `src/`; the only call sites in the tree are five, in exactly the two fixtures this
  row names — `tests/logos/pass/query_lenient_e2e.logos` and
  `tests/logos/pass/query_lenient_null_fuzz_adv.logos`. So "no caller after the cut" is true, but
  "already dead code" would be FALSE: the cut withdraws a tested capability, not an unused one.
- **Both symbols are ABI-exported** (`abi/logos.abi`: `QEnv__bind_node_erased__f__refmut_QEnv__slice_u8__WAny`,
  `QEnv__bind_source_erased__f__refmut_QEnv__slice_u8__WAny`). Removing the methods is an ABI BREAK —
  authorised, but it must be a deliberate regenerate + version bump, not a side effect of deleting a file.
- **Why no static form exists, and it is two missing features, not a slice.** (i) There is no erased COLUMN:
  `SemaChecker::native_source_spec` stamps every rel column type concretely from the `Src` impl's trait
  args, and `sema_collect.cpp`'s rel-column check refuses any column type that does not implement `Hash`
  (`rel item(v: WAny)` → ``a rel column type must implement `Hash` ``, exit 1). With no `dyn` column there
  is nowhere for the CEL Null table (`docs/spec/deem.md`) to attach. (ii) There is no runtime BY-NAME field
  resolution: field access is typed against the concrete column type.

*The ruling.* CEL-style Null propagation over string-keyed rows is **withdrawn from the language** with the
interpreter. It is not deferred and not "unspecified": a `deem` item whose source parameter carries an
erased Writ slot is now REFUSED at the item, with the ground stated —
`SemaChecker::enrich_deem_params` (`src/compiler/sema_expr.cpp`), predicate `names_erased_writ_slot_`.
Doors: `tests/logos/fail/deem_erased_source_fail` (`&[WAny]`, the `bind_source_erased` shape) and
`tests/logos/fail/deem_erased_node_fail` (`&WAny`, the `bind_node_erased` shape).

⚠ *Why those doors are not the worthless kind.* Before the check both programs ALREADY failed, and neither
refusal was evidence about erasure: `&[WAny]` died at `<metaprog-blob-subst>:1` with `field read: receiver
is not a struct (got &WAny)` — unlocated, grounded in a rule about structs — and `&WAny` died with the
stdlib walker's ``source `t` is not a slice``, a statement about SHAPE that covers `t: &i64` equally. Each
`.expected` therefore pins the LINE of the offending item plus the ground clause (compile-time column
typing; the withdrawn binding named). MEASURED both ways: perturbing the predicate in the compiler reddens
both doors, and so does a perturbation that withdraws the whole `deem` ITEM form — the second is the check
that a broader refusal cannot satisfy them.

*What is NOT claimed.* The `QEnv` methods and their two pass fixtures are still present; this ruling states
the disposition and pins the static tier's answer. Deleting them is P5's own step, with the ABI bump above.

**C4 — the dynamic graph walker** (rows 56, 57, and the loss half of B rows 6, 69, 70, 71).
`ts_scan` lives in `exec.logos`. The graph vocabulary (parent, key, idx, child, kind, tag, vi, vs) is
declared ONE vocabulary across binding times with exactly two implementations — `ts_scan` and
`writ_graph_edges`. Delete one and the parity claim is unfalsifiable; the four B rows keep only their
static half. Requirement: move `ts_scan` (and `QB_TSRC` / `CT_TREESRC` handling) into a source module
independent of the executor, or record that the vocabulary is now single-sourced and the drift class
those four fixtures caught is reopened.

**C5 — the fuzz method** (rows 11, 13, 42). All three generate query TEXT at runtime; a macro cannot be
generated at runtime, so the static tier can only fuzz DATA over fixed shapes — which is what
`query_diff_static` does, and it is strictly weaker (it cannot vary the shape, and it has no string-column
or lenient-mode instance). Requirement: a metaprog-time shape generator emitting `deem` items, i.e. a
compile-time fuzzer, or an accepted reduction to fixed-shape/fuzzed-data with the string dimension added
to `query_diff_static`.

## 6. THE LOSS LEDGER — what the tree gives up if P5 proceeds anyway

Victor decides this. Each entry is a shipped capability with no static counterpart today.

* **L1 — trace reification** (ADR 0015 §1, invariant I1). `IncrRec` recording `TraceStep`/`TraceEpoch`
  about its own evaluation. Witness: `query_incr_trace_e2e`.
* **L2 — budgeted / anytime fixpoint** (§3). `set_budget_steps`/`set_budget_ns`, `TruncatedTail`,
  resume-from-watermark. Witness: `query_incr_budget_e2e`.
* **L3 — control atoms + journal + I2 boundary** (§4). Witness: `query_incr_ctl_journal_e2e`.
* **L4 — R4 provenance / `IncrRec::explain`** — witness-chain reconstruction. Witness: `query_incr_prov_e2e`.
* **L5 — `FactStore` / `FactHistory`**: content-keyed presence set, `take_delta`, the append-only journal
  and `replay_fresh`. `stdlib/lcm/deem/facthistory.logos` goes with it. Witnesses:
  `query_incr_factstore_e2e_{join,rec}`, `query_incr_journal_replay`.
* **L6 — S4 assumption branches** (`select_one` fork/merge over a live engine, law I4).
  Witness: `query_incr_s4_select_one`.
* **L7 — the Nous observer ladder rungs 0 and 1.** Both are built on IncrRec's budget cut + trace +
  control atoms; L1's "action" is a control atom whose argument is the derived pending count. Witnesses:
  `query_proto_observer_l0`, `query_observer_l1`. This is the entry that is not a database feature.
* **L8 — the runtime template engine** (`Tpl`), ADR 0011 / ADR 0012-queue2 §§2,3,6,7. §5 C2.
* **L9 — the engine as a `deem!` source** (ADR 0016 M5 case S): the `EngineState` trait,
  `<p>_trace`/`_epochs`/`_tail`/`_controls`. §1b.
* **L10 — runtime query compilation itself**: `Query::compile` over TEXT, re-entrancy over different
  envs, runtime join-tier dispatch, runtime `rel` fixpoint (`query_interp_smoke` enumerates exactly this),
  lenient/erased binding (§5 C3), and the ORACLE role the interpreter plays for the static tier in the 25
  class-B differentials — after the cut, 25 fixtures lose their second opinion.
* **L11 — the DRed harvest fixtures** (`deem_dred_phases23_spec`, `wql_incr_rec_agg_retract_lattice`,
  `wql_incr_rec_dred_error_window`). ⚠ These were written to preserve knowledge THROUGH P5 and they do
  not: each drives `Query::compile` + `incremental_rec`, so each dies with its subject. Harvest by fixture
  does not survive the deletion of what it harvests — only harvest by static re-implementation does.

---

## 7. Gates that move, and must be RE-PINNED (never weakened)

* `tests/logos/rtval_domain_gate.sh` (`logos_09_rtval_domain`, `tier_commit`, registered in
  `tests/logos/CMakeLists.txt`) globs `*.logos` in `stdlib/mem/deem` and asserts three hard constants:
  `WANT_VARIANTS="B Error F I Node Null S"`, `WANT_MATCH_SITES=27`, `WANT_KIND_CALLS=27`.
  ⚠ The crude per-LINE count first recorded here (eval 11, exec 2, query 1, deem 4) UNDERCOUNTS: by
  OCCURRENCE it is eval **20**, exec **4**, query **1**, deem **4** — 25 of 29 inside the cut, so the
  conclusion holds a fortiori.
  **MEASURED that the gate bites** (verification pass): one extra `rt_kind(` call site planted in
  `deem.logos` (`fn __probe_kind_site`) turned `logos_09_rtval_domain` red with
  `the rt_kind i32-CODE dispatch surface moved: 28 call site(s)`, ctest exit **8**; reverting restored
  green. The gate reads SOURCE TEXT, so it reds with no rebuild — it will red on the cut and must be
  re-measured and re-stated, with the header sentence ("`RtVal` is the value of BOTH the dynamic query engine and the
  incremental one") rewritten, because it stops being true. `tests/logos/rtval_fallback.ledger` is
  currently empty by design and its `deleted-by` discipline applies here.
* `tests/logos/abi_closure_gate.sh` — built on the derived closure that gives
  `type logos.mem.deem.RtVal` a record; `is_deem_api_type` in `src/compiler/emit_module.cpp` names five
  types by hand — `Query`, `SchemaCatalog`, `QEnv`, `QRows`, `QError` — and TWO of them (`Query`, `QRows`)
  cease to exist. ANSWERED (verification pass, by reading `is_deem_api_type` / `is_deem_internal_type`):
  it is a pure `std::string_view` comparison used as an EXCLUSION predicate — no lookup, so a name that
  no longer resolves is silently DEAD, not an error. The consequence is that the derived closure
  `deem_abi_admitted` starts from a two-thirds-alive seed and SHRINKS, dropping every spec record that
  was admitted only because `Query`/`QRows` named it. That reads as record REMOVAL, so `abi-check.sh`
  will report BREAKING and demand a deliberate bump — the gate bites, but only after the deletion.
* Every deleted fixture has a matching `add_test` entry in `tests/logos/CMakeLists.txt`; the registry
  count (`ctest -N`, 6950 all / 3267 `-LE imported` at `9ebb6110`) must be PREDICTED before the cut and
  compared after — a test that silently stops existing is the failure mode this repo has already met.

---

## 7b. Verification pass — what an adversarial re-measure CONFIRMED

Re-measured independently at `8cf79102` (build green, clang-20, `LOGOS_EMIT_SHARDS=8`):

* Every sole-definition row of §1a: confirmed by `grep -rnE '^(pub )?(fn|struct) …' stdlib/`. Call counts
  44 / 25 confirmed. `Query { … }` constructed at exactly one site, in `query.logos`'s `Query::compile`.
* §2 arithmetic AT `8cf79102`: 1672+1472+606+963 = 4713 (P5 as written), +1978+1466+92+514 = **8763**.
  Confirmed AT THAT TREE and SUPERSEDED at `8c5ad0ea`: the template port shrank `check.logos` to 974 and
  `exec.logos` to 1450 and deleted `eval.logos` (606 → gone), so the four-file cut is 974+1450+963 =
  **3387** and the whole-tier cut is +1978+1466+92+514 = **7437**. §2 carries the current table.
* The three DRed harvest fixtures: `deem_dred_phases23_spec`, `wql_incr_rec_agg_retract_lattice`,
  `wql_incr_rec_dred_error_window` each declare ZERO `deem` items and each reaches `Query::compile` +
  `q.incremental_rec(&env)`. L11 stands: harvest by fixture does not survive.
* The B→A correction: all eleven have zero `deem` declarations; every `_apply(` hit in them is a local
  `src_apply`/`nasty_apply`/`edge_apply`. Confirmed — the `_apply(` grep was indeed a false signal.
* Row 48 `query_rec_agg_batch_e2e` is the one row filed A while HAVING a static arm (`sssp`, `longest`),
  which by this file's own class definitions is B. The A verdict survives on the merits, not the rule:
  the static half is duplicated by `wql_rel_sssp_e2e` and `wql_rel_widest_path_e2e` (both interp-free,
  both carrying an independent Bellman-Ford / bottleneck oracle) and the cycle case by
  `wql_rel_neg_cycle_abort`.
* Rows 23/33/35 (`query_incr_guard`, `query_incr_sssp_guard`, `query_incr_tc_guard`) guard the DYNAMIC
  entry points and return `Result::Err` values; the static tier keeps its own door for the same rule
  (`tests/logos/fail/wql_rel_agg_group_cycle_fail`). A is correct.
* Registry unmoved by this commit: `ctest -N` 6950 all / 3267 `-LE imported` / 29 `-L '^tier_commit$'`.
  `git diff --stat 9ebb6110 8cf79102 -- stdlib src tests tools abi scripts` is EMPTY, so no emitted
  symbol can have moved; absolute baseline recorded for the next attempt — `wql_rel_sssp_e2e` (rel)
  155 defined symbols, `wql_aggregate_e2e` (non-rel) 283.
* `scripts/abi-check.sh` RC **0**, `VERDICT: ABI-PRESERVING`, sym 12695 / type 365 / vtable 115 /
  schema 2 identical to the `origin/main` base; `abi/logos.abi` correctly NOT regenerated. L1 and L2
  green (691/691, 1890/1890).

## 8. Not measured here

* `scripts/abi-check.sh` was not run: nothing was edited, so its verdict would be about the unmodified
  tree and would say nothing about the deletion.
* The dead residue INSIDE `deem.logos` after the cut (which of its ~40 functions lose every caller).
* Whether each class-B remainder still bites once its interpreter arm is gone — per fixture, by breaking
  it and predicting the exit code. This is the largest piece of work the next attempt owes.
* Build/L4 impact of the cut: no branch of this repo has ever compiled without these files.
